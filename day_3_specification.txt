====== Day 3 specification ======

A valid wire run input file shall follow the following syntax rules:

    - magnitude_sets := magnitude_set new_line {magnitude_sets}
    - magnitude_set := magnitude_element {"," magnitude_element}
    - new_line := [CR] LF
    - magnitude_element := direction_character magnitude
    - direction_character := "U" | "D" | "L" | "R"
    - magnitude := digit {digit}
    - digit := "0" | "1" | "2" | ... | "9"

No space shall be allowed between elements unless otherwise specified.

Results output is considered output to answer the question of the
minimum Manhattan distance that two or more wire sets intersect at given
an input file representation of the wire run directions.

The program shall parse an input file, rejecting invalid input files at
runtime.  The program may reject an invalid input file during
intermediate processing, however no results output shall be produced for
an invalid input file.

The program shall parse the digits assuming base 10.

The program shall parse a valid input file into a number of sets equal
to the number of lines in the file.

The program shall assume the file has a new line at the end of the last
line of a file (conforming to the standard unix specification that there
is a new line at the end of a file).

The program shall output the distance 0 if there is only 1 wire set.

The program shall output the distance of the closest interesection of all sets
if there is more than 1 wire set.

The program shall output the distance "inf" as the closest intersection if
there is no intersections between more than 1 wire set.

Upon reading a magnitude_element token, the program shall add to a set
of coordinates by the following rules:

    1. The current coordinates are to be X and Y.  If formatting for
       human-readable purposes, they shall be printed as (X,Y).
    2. The magnitude shall be represented by M.
    3. If the direction_character is "L" or "D", the magnitude shall be
       negated (M := -M).
    4. If the direction_character is "L" or "R", each coordinate between
       (X,Y) and (X+M,Y), not including the (X,Y) coordinate, shall be
       added to the wire set.
    5. If the direction_character is "U" or "D", each coordinate between
       (X,Y) and (X,Y+M), not including the (X,Y) coordinate, shall be
       added to the wire set.
